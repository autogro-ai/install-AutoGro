# AutoGro Installer **Alpha**
We've built an installer to get your environment setup on your Raspberry Pi!

Open your Terminal And paste this command below to install the software.

```cd ~/Downloads/install-autogro && source setup_autogro.sh```

You should see something like this below. If you get an error running the command above, double check that you downloaded the install-autogro folder to your Downloads folder and it's unzipped.
